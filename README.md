# skid-search
Made for quickly searching through github repositories to find the most popular stuff, you can search in-text and in-title, aswell as extract any available source-code from a post. Also has a thing "larp tool", which displays a bunch of fake IPs, and says they've been "Hacked", this was just a fun project, pretty much useless.
